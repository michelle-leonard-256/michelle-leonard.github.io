[![Dicey Dungeons: Familiar Foundations](https://img.youtube.com/vi/8deRL3whkKo/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8deRL3whkKo)

A video essay analyzing the aesthetic and mechanic legacies that inspired Dicey Dungeons (Terry Cavanagh, 2019) which make it so easy and so fun to play. Made with the patience and grace of my mother. I filmed clips using OBS, edited the essay in Adobe Premiere Pro, and recorded narration under a blanket in my closet. Co-written and -narrated with Aaron Moss.

My first TTRPG: GM-less, no-prep, lightweight, d6-based, 3-7 players; basically, everything I found myself wishing for in a game I could play with my friends. It was a fun exercise in ludonarrative consonance!

### Bumper Cars
[![A gif showing a pixel-styled video game. A red car and a blue car race around a track in a grassy field. Occasionally they bump into each other or a tree and lose a heart.](https://github.com/michelle-leonard-256/michelle-leonard-256.github.io/blob/0b5d2456a4351e2d85c8eb337f5b2b5aa1f0ae63/_includes/video1.gif)](https://github.com/michelle-leonard-256/michelle-leonard-256.github.io/blob/0b5d2456a4351e2d85c8eb337f5b2b5aa1f0ae63/_includes/video1.gif)
A bumper-cars game made in TIC-80, a small fantasy console that uses Lua. I implemented collision logic, multi-player support, and drew the pixel art. Code base and car sprites from [Josh Goebel's](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki/Driving-Model) TIC-80 vectors tutorial. Coded in collaboration with a classmate for a Swarthmore CS86 lab.
